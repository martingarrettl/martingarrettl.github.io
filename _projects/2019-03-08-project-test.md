Built up the initiative to actually launch a personal website.
Followed this helpful guide by <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">Jonathan McGlone</a>.
Currently intend to continue to learn the Jekyll framework powering the website in order to refine the design and functionality of the website.
