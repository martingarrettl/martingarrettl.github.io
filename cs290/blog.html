          <h3>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you solve them?</h3>
          <p>Largest challenge for me with this assignment was trying to remember html without looking anything up after not using for at least 5 years. Solved through liberal application of caffeine.</p>
          <h3>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</h3>
          <p>So far, I was able to complete this assignment using just what I managed to pull from my memory of html.</p>
          <h3>What resources were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</h3>
          <p>I utilized no resources outside of my memory.</p>

          <h3>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</h3>
          <p>The most challenging aspect was trying to get the dang weights correct on the fonts. Not sure if it's a problem with the linux version of Firefox, but I just couldn't get the title to look right.</p>
          <h3>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</h3>
          <p>A lot of this is still just a refresher on stuff i've already learned before, but using css to transform was specifically new to me.</p>
          <h3>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</h3>
          <p>Liberal dose of googlin' stuff is my goto problem solver. Haven't had to use another method yet.</p>
          <h3>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h3>
          <p>Once again, css tranforms. Although I pretty much just googled stuff all the time, specifically what attribute everything had and in what order they came in.</p>

          <h3>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</h3>
          <p>The most difficult part of the assignment was getting the search functioning as required. I knew how I wanted to implement it but I kept running into trouble with my ignorance of JavaScript.</p>
          <h3>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</h3>
          <p>I have not used JavaScript in any real capacity before this assignment so that's the primary thing I started learning.</p>
          <h3>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</h3>
          <p>Once again google was my friend whenever I ran into a roadblock with JavaScript, but more specifically Mozilla's dev resources were really great and informative.</p>
          <h3>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h3>
          <p>I had to look up a bunch of different things about JavaScript, but specifically I kept looking up things I was sure existed, but not sure of what they specifically were. Like querySelectorAll and remove.</p>

          <h3>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you solve them?</h3>
          <p>The single greatest challenge was figuring out I didn't have to overcomplicate anything. Spent HOURS working on a "smarter" solution that sucked.</p>
          <h3>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</h3>
          <p>First time using node.js so it was all pretty new to me.</p>
          <h3>What resources were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</h3>
          <p>I googled the ever-living heck out of the problems I was having with my earlier versions of server.js, but i kept getting solutions that involed express.js which was annoying. Once I swapped to my simpler server.js I basically only need the class notes.</p>
