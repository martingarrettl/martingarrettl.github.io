Built up the initiative to actually launch a personal website.
Followed <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">this</a> helpful guide by Jonathan McGlone.
Currently intend to continue to learn the Jekyll framework powering the website in order to refine the design and functionality of the website.
